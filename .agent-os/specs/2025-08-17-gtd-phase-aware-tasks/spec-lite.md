# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement file-type aware task recognition that respects GTD phases by allowing inbox files to recognize all `- [ ]` items without #task tags (pure capture) while maintaining #task requirements for other GTD files (Obsidian Tasks compatibility). Add inbox capture tool for frictionless task entry following GTD quick-capture principles with clear separation between captured and clarified items.
