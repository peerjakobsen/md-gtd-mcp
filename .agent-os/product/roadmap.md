# Roadmap

## Phase 1: Foundation & Core MCP Server (MVP)
**Status**: ~73% Complete (11/15 features implemented)

**Goal**: Build a functional MCP server that can read and analyze Obsidian GTD markdown files

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ MCP server responds to queries about GTD system (setup_gtd_vault, read_gtd_file, list_gtd_files, read_gtd_files)
- ‚úÖ Can read and parse Obsidian markdown files with frontmatter (MarkdownParser, TaskExtractor, LinkExtractor)
- ‚úÖ Can create and manage GTD vault structure (setup_gtd_vault with safe file creation)
- ‚è≥ Provides simple inbox categorization suggestions (not yet implemented)

**Features**:
- [x] MCP Server Setup (S) - FastMCP server with basic tool registration, server instructions, and meta information for GTD context
- [x] Obsidian Vault Integration (M) - Read markdown files, parse frontmatter and links. Implemented with MarkdownParser, LinkExtractor, and VaultReader
- [x] File System Navigation (S) - Browse GTD folder structure and find relevant files. VaultReader handles file type detection
- [x] Basic Markdown Parsing (M) - Extract tasks, projects, and GTD categories from markdown. TaskExtractor, LinkExtractor, MarkdownParser complete
- [üìã] GTD Phase-Aware Task Recognition (M) - **DESIGNED** (Decision D006 made, implementation pending). Implement file-type aware task recognition respecting GTD phases. Inbox files recognize ALL `- [ ]` items without #task requirement (pure capture). Other GTD files require #task tags for Obsidian Tasks plugin compatibility. Creates clear distinction between captured and clarified items
- [ ] Inbox Capture Tool (S) - MCP tool for adding items directly to inbox without requiring contexts or detailed metadata. Follows GTD quick-capture principle where contexts are assigned during Clarify phase, not Capture phase
- [ ] Simple Categorization Logic (L) - Suggest GTD categories for inbox items using MCP prompts that guide Claude Desktop through GTD methodology (relates to Decision D008)
- [üîß] MCP Tool Descriptions & Annotations (M) - **BASIC** (basic descriptions exist, GTD enhancements needed). Enhanced tool descriptions with GTD context, usage examples, and behavioral hints (readOnlyHint, destructiveHint, idempotentHint) to guide LLM behavior. Tools include meta information indicating GTD phase (capture/clarify/organize/reflect/engage) and typical usage frequency
- [ ] MCP Prompts for GTD Workflows (M) - **HIGH PRIORITY** (Decision D008). Pre-configured prompt templates using @mcp.prompt decorator to orchestrate GTD workflows through Claude Desktop's LLM intelligence without requiring server-side API access: inbox_clarification, weekly_review, project_decomposition, daily_planning, stall_detection, context_switching. Prompts guide Claude through proper GTD methodology and eliminate API key barriers for users
- [x] Configuration System (S) - JSON config for vault paths and basic preferences. VaultConfig class implemented
- [x] Vault Setup Tool (S) - setup_gtd_vault creates complete GTD folder structure safely without overwriting existing files
- [x] Read GTD File Tool (S) - read_gtd_file for parsing single GTD files with frontmatter and tasks
- [x] List GTD Files Tool (S) - list_gtd_files for vault overview with metadata and filtering
- [x] Read GTD Files Tool (M) - read_gtd_files for batch reading with comprehensive content extraction
- [x] Convert Read-Only Operations to Resources (M) - **COMPLETED** (Decision D007). Successfully converted list_gtd_files, read_gtd_file, and read_gtd_files from tools to resources following MCP protocol best practices. Resources provide semantic correctness for read-only operations and better LLM understanding through readOnlyHint annotations. Implemented URIs: gtd://{vault_path}/files, gtd://{vault_path}/file/{file_path}, gtd://{vault_path}/content, plus filtered variants
- [x] Integration Testing Suite (L) - 10 end-to-end workflow scenarios tested (onboarding, migration, processing, review, etc.)
- [x] Error Handling & Validation (M) - Robust error handling for file operations and invalid inputs. Comprehensive error recovery tested

## Phase 2: Intelligent Processing & Project Management
**Goal**: Add AI-powered insights for project decomposition and workflow automation

**Success Criteria**:
- Can break down projects into actionable next steps
- Identifies stalled projects and suggests improvements
- Processes multiple inbox items efficiently

**Features**:
- [ ] Advanced Text Analysis (L) - MCP prompt-guided extraction of actions, contexts, and priorities from text using Claude Desktop's intelligence for context detection (@home, @office, @calls, @errands). Focus on Clarify phase analysis rather than Capture phase requirements
- [ ] Intelligent Context Assignment (M) - Use MCP prompts to guide Claude Desktop in suggesting appropriate GTD contexts during Clarify phase based on task content analysis. Respects GTD methodology by NOT requiring contexts during initial capture
- [ ] Process Inbox Tool (L) - MCP prompt-driven guidance for transition from Capture to Clarify phase. Use inbox_clarification prompt to help Claude Desktop analyze inbox items and suggest GTD categories, contexts, and priority assignments with explanations. Adds #task tag when processing items, transforming raw captures into actionable tasks with processing audit trail
- [ ] Project Decomposition Engine (XL) - Use project_decomposition MCP prompt to guide Claude Desktop in breaking high-level projects into specific, actionable tasks following GTD methodology
- [ ] Stall Detection System (M) - Use stall_detection MCP prompt to guide Claude Desktop in identifying projects without recent activity or clear next actions
- [ ] Batch Inbox Processing (L) - Handle multiple captured thoughts simultaneously with consistent logic
- [ ] Context & Priority Recognition (L) - Identify GTD contexts (@calls, @errands) and priority indicators during appropriate GTD phases
- [ ] Intelligent Tool Naming & Organization (S) - GTD-specific tool names (process_inbox, capture_item, review_projects) with proper categorization and tags for LLM understanding
- [ ] Context-Aware Tool Transformation (M) - Dynamic tool adaptation using Tool.from_tool() patterns to create specialized versions based on user context (e.g., transform generic "process_item" into "process_meeting_notes" or "process_email_capture" with appropriate parameter defaults)
- [ ] Template System (M) - Customizable templates for different project types and workflows
- [ ] SOP System Foundation (M) - **NEW** (Decision D009). Establish SOPs folder structure (`GTD/SOPs/`) and simple project-SOP linking via metadata in single `projects.md` file. Enable organization-specific workflow customization through user-maintained standard operating procedures
- [ ] SOP Template Creation Tool (S) - **NEW** (Decision D009). MCP tool to create starter SOP templates with standardized GTD-integrated structure (7 sections: GTD Clarification Questions, Project Decomposition, Context Rules, Review Checkpoints, Success Criteria, Common Patterns, Anti-patterns). Covers common procedures: 1:1 meetings, MEDDPICC sales, monthly reports, career development, code review, incident response. Users customize content directly in Obsidian
- [ ] SOP-Enhanced Prompts (L) - **NEW** (Decision D009). Enhance existing MCP prompts (project_decomposition, weekly_review, etc.) to dynamically read and incorporate relevant SOPs when processing projects. Enables context-aware GTD workflows following organization-specific procedures
- [ ] SOP Discovery System (S) - **NEW** (Decision D009). Auto-suggest relevant SOPs for new projects based on project names, patterns, and existing SOP library. Reduces friction in linking projects to appropriate procedures
- [ ] Linking Intelligence (M) - Understand and suggest connections between related projects and notes

## Phase 3: Review Automation & Analytics
**Goal**: Automate GTD reviews and provide productivity insights

**Success Criteria**:
- Generates comprehensive weekly review summaries

- Reduces review time by 50% through automation

**Features**:
- [ ] Weekly Review Generator (L) - Use weekly_review MCP prompt to guide Claude Desktop in generating comprehensive summaries of completed actions and project status
- [ ] Productivity Pattern Analysis (XL) - Use MCP prompts to guide Claude Desktop in identifying trends, bottlenecks, and optimization opportunities from GTD data
- [ ] Focus Recommendations (L) - Use daily_planning and context_switching MCP prompts to guide Claude Desktop in suggesting priority areas based on context, energy, and available time
- [ ] Progress Tracking Dashboard (M) - Visual insights into project advancement and completion rates
