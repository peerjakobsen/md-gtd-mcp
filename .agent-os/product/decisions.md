## Decision Log

### D001: Product Planning and Agent OS Integration
- **Status**: Decided
- **Date**: 2025-08-10
- **Category**: Architecture
- **Stakeholders**: Product Owner

**Context**: Need to establish foundation for MCP server development with clear product vision, technical architecture, and development roadmap.

**Alternatives**:
1. Start coding immediately with minimal planning
2. Create comprehensive Agent OS documentation structure
3. Use lightweight documentation approach

**Decision**: Implement full Agent OS product planning structure with mission, tech-stack, roadmap, and decision logging.

**Rationale**:
- Provides clear direction for AI-assisted development
- Enables effective agent consumption of product requirements
- Establishes decision audit trail for future reference
- Aligns with Agent OS best practices for structured development

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Clear product vision and development path
- Positive: Enables effective AI agent assistance throughout development
- Positive: Provides framework for tracking progress and decisions
- Neutral: Additional upfront documentation effort

### D002: FastMCP as Core Framework
- **Status**: Decided
- **Date**: 2025-08-10
- **Category**: Technology
- **Stakeholders**: Development Team

**Context**: Need to select MCP server framework for building GTD workflow automation.

**Alternatives**:
1. FastMCP - Python-based MCP server framework
2. Custom MCP implementation from scratch
3. Node.js based MCP server

**Decision**: Use FastMCP as the core framework for MCP server development.

**Rationale**:
- Aligns with Agent OS Python-first technology standards
- Provides proven MCP protocol implementation
- Reduces development complexity and time-to-market
- Strong community support and documentation

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Faster development with proven framework
- Positive: Consistent with technology stack preferences
- Positive: Access to FastMCP community and resources
- Negative: Framework dependency and potential limitations

### D003: MCP Best Practices for LLM Integration
- **Status**: Decided
- **Date**: 2025-08-16
- **Category**: Architecture
- **Stakeholders**: Development Team, Product Owner

**Context**: Research into FastMCP best practices revealed specific patterns and techniques needed to ensure optimal LLM (Claude Desktop) understanding and usage of MCP servers. Standard functional implementation is insufficient for effective AI interaction.

**Alternatives**:
1. Implement basic MCP tools with minimal descriptions
2. Focus only on functional capabilities without LLM optimization
3. Implement comprehensive FastMCP best practices for LLM interaction

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive FastMCP best practices including enhanced tool descriptions, MCP prompts, annotations, meta information, and interactive features.

**Rationale**:
- LLMs require detailed context and usage guidance to effectively use tools
- FastMCP provides proven patterns (tool descriptions, prompts, annotations) for LLM interaction
- GTD methodology benefits from structured prompts and guided workflows
- Interactive features (elicitation, sampling) enable complex decision-making workflows
- Proper tool organization and naming improves discoverability and usage

**Implementation Details**:
- Tool descriptions enhanced with GTD context and usage examples
- Behavioral annotations (readOnlyHint, destructiveHint, idempotentHint) guide LLM behavior
- Meta information indicates GTD phases and usage frequency
- Pre-configured prompts for common GTD workflows (weekly review, inbox processing)
- Tool transformation patterns for context-specific adaptations
- Interactive elicitation for structured data gathering during GTD processes

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Optimal Claude Desktop integration and user experience
- Positive: Structured approach to GTD workflow automation
- Positive: Leverages FastMCP framework capabilities effectively
- Positive: Provides foundation for advanced AI-assisted GTD features
- Neutral: Additional implementation complexity and documentation requirements
- Negative: Increased initial development effort for comprehensive descriptions and prompts
