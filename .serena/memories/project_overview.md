# Project Overview

## Purpose
This is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for markdown-based Getting Things Done (GTD) system. The server enables AI assistants to interact with GTD workflows stored in Obsidian markdown files, providing intelligent inbox processing, project management, and review automation.

## Project Goals
- Bridge AI automation with personal productivity systems
- Process GTD workflows in Obsidian markdown files
- Provide intelligent inbox categorization and project management
- Automate review processes and productivity analytics

## Current Status
- Basic MCP server infrastructure is complete (~14% of Phase 1)
- Only hello_world tool implemented as proof of concept
- Core GTD functionality still needs to be built

## Key Features (Planned)
- Read and parse Obsidian markdown files with frontmatter
- GTD categorization: Projects, Next Actions, Waiting For, Someday/Maybe, Reference
- Support for Obsidian-style [[wikilinks]] and standard markdown links
- Intelligent inbox processing and project decomposition
- Weekly review automation and productivity analytics

## Development Approach
- 3-phase roadmap from MVP to full analytics platform
- Agent OS structured development methodology
- Test-driven development with comprehensive test suites
